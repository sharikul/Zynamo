# Zynamo Templating Engine
Zynamo is a very simple templating engine written in PHP. It was developed to be used to substitute commonly typed words and characters with a key which can be called in a <strong>PHP</strong> script.  

## Start using Zynamo
To begin using Zynamo, firstly open `zynamo_config.php`. You'll find an empty array called "items". This is where you store keys linking to their value. Zynamo uses the `key => value` format, and is the format you are required to use to store keys.
